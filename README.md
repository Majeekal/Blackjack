## Blackjack Project - Week 4 Skill Distillery

### Overview

This is a BlackJack Game. 
This program deals starts the game off by shuffling the deck and dealing two cards to you and the dealer. One of the dealers cards is initially hidden until after your turn. You will be given the option to hit or stay during your turn. If you hit and go over 21 you bust and lose the game. If you hit 21 and the dealer does not then you have a Blackjack and win the game. If both you and the dealer gets blackjack then dealer takes the win. Once you are finished with your turn and noone busted or got a blackjack, then the dealer will have an opportunity to take a turn. If the dealer's total is below 17 then he will automatically hit until he is 17 or above. If the dealer is 17 or above the dealer must stay. Once the dealer is complete with it's turn then the scores will be compared. If the player has a higher score without busting then the player whens. Same for the other way around. If both players have the same score then it is a push and noone wins.
